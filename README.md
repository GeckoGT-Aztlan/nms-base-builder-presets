# No Man's Sky Base Builder Presets

A central place for the Blender community to store presets for the No Man's Sky Base Builder!

## How to get Presets from this repository

All presets can be browsed and downloaded by exploring this repository. Within the `presets` folder are categories like `Cyber` or `Vehicles`.

Within these categories are a series of `JSON` files which correspond to a particular preset.

These `JSON` files are labelled with an `AUTHOR_DESCRIPTION.json` format to give an idea of what the preset is and to give credit to the maker of that preset.

These can be downloaded into your No Man's Sky Base Builder user folder located here.
