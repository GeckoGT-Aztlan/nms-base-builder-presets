# No Man's Sky Base Builder Presets

A central place for the Blender community to store presets for the [No Man's Sky Base Builder](https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/984)!

## How to get Presets from this repository

All presets can be browsed and downloaded by exploring this repository. At the root level are a series of categories like `Cyber` or `Vehicles`.

Within these categories are a series of `JSON` files which correspond to a particular preset.

These `JSON` files are labelled with an `AUTHOR_DESCRIPTION.json` format to give an idea of what the preset is and to give credit to the maker of that preset.

These can be downloaded and placed into your No Man's Sky Base Builder user folder located here.

```
%USERPROFILE%/NoMansSkyBaseBuilder/presets/
```

## How to contribute

GitHub already has a help page for adding files to a repository.

https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository

Follow this guide to add your own presets to a `category` and labelled with the `AUTHOR_DESCRIPTION.json` format. For example.

```
nms-base-builder-presets/Cyber/djmonkey_Cafe.json
nms-base-builder-presets/Cyber/djmonkey_Dome.json
nms-base-builder-presets/Cyber/djmonkey_Food.json
nms-base-builder-presets/Cyber/djmonkey_Pilon.json
nms-base-builder-presets/Cyber/djmonkey_Store.json
```

After following this guide, a new `Pull Request` will be set up, where your new Presets
will be previewed and eventually merged to the `master` branch where everyone can see and download them.

At this stage you just need to wait until you get an email saying your files have been merged.

If you haven't followed the naming guide lines then I may ask you to try again.
